Scholarships are given on a case-by-case basis.

To request a $1/day or $2/day scholarship, you must email the following information (_please block out all sensitive information such as bank account numbers and social security numbers before emailing documents_). If your scholarship request is approved, we will send you a special registration link with the reduced rates. This is the only way to pay at reduced rates. Please send us:

* Proof of income: benefits letter (SNAP, SSI/SSDI, TANF) or check stubs for the last 30 days
* Bank statement
* Letter from school stating your child is eligible for free/reduced lunch. If registering multiple children, please send letter for each child.
