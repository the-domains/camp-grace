What else you should know about Camp F.U.S.E. and what to expect!

## How much does it cost?

Our primary goal is to serve the families with the greatest financial AND summer childcare needs (very low-income families who have no other summer childcare options available to them). We are happy to serve all families, but those with less financial and/or summer childcare needs will pay more. Here's a price explanation (broken down by average daily cost), from highest to lowest:

**$4/day: Week-to-week Price- **Want your kids to attend just one or two weeks of camp? This is the way to go.

**$3/day: Regular Price- **If you register your child for the entire summer program, you will pay this price if your child is _not eligible_ for free/reduced school lunch prices.

**$2/day: Regular Price- **If you register your child for the entire summer program, you will pay this price if your child is eligible for REDUCED school lunch prices.

**$1/day: Regular Price- **If you register your child for the entire summer program, you will pay this price if your child is eligible for FREE school lunch prices.

## How do I get the reduced rates?

Please go to the "Scholarships Available" link on the home page, or click here: [http://campfuse.com/scholarships-available][0]

### **Do I have to pay online?**

Yes

## What is the minimum age to attend?

5 years old.

## Do you provide transportation?

No.

## What are the Extended Care Hours?

Extended Care begins at 7:30 (30 minutes before camp opens) and ends at 6:00pm (3 hours after camp closes).

## How much is Extended Care?

Extended Care is $25 per week, per child. Payment must be made by Monday morning of each week you would like your child to attend.

## Are reduced rates available for Extended Care?

No.

## Is dinner provided at Extended Care?

No.

## Do I need to provide lunch for my child?

Not unless your child has special food requirements (e.g. allergies or food intolerances). We partner with Tarrant Area Food Bank who supplies our breakfast and lunch meals. We also participate in their summer backpack program where each child goes home with a bag of food items at the end of the week so they can prepare their own meal if needed. If you do decide to pack a lunch for your child, please keep in mind that we do not allow any soda, chips or candy unless you bring enough for every child.

## Who is able to receive a meal?

While our camp is tailored to those 5-13, any child from the community can come in and receive breakfast or lunch. The meal must be eaten on site and the child will be asked to leave once meal time is over.

## There is a chance we will go out of town during one of the sessions, can I get a refund?

If you think there is the possibility of your child missing more than half of a session, please register through the _Weekly Sign Up_. Please note that while we understand emergencies happen, we have dedicated this time to serve you and your family and would love for your child to come to Camp FUSE as much as possible. We work hard to ensure we have enough staff and volunteers available therefore we will not issue any refunds on weeks missed.

Also, while we do not expect to send your child home, please note that in the case that either we or you decide that the camp is not for your child there will not be any refunds given. It is very important to talk to your child about their expected behavior and participation. We want everyone to grow from this experience and enjoy their time at camp.

## How and when do I make my payment?

Payment is due by the morning of the first day of each session which is on a Monday except for the 2nd session which falls on a Tuesday.

"I have to be at work by 8am and I do not get off until 4 pm, what are my options?"

We offer our Extended Fun package that covers 7:30 am drop off and 6 pm pick up. Payment is due each week by Monday morning.

## What happens if I'm late picking up my child?

A â€Ž$1 per minute late fee will be assessed after 3:10 pm (fee will not exceed $20). If your child is not enrolled in Extended Fun program or you have not notified the camp staff that you are running late your child will be taken to the police department at 3:30pm. The late fee must be paid the next morning before you will be allowed to drop off your child.

## Will my child be required to participate in all activities?

Yes, we work hard to ensure that we have age, ability and interest appropriate activities for your child. All activities, including chapel are required. It helps build your child's socialization skills, confidence and character. We all learn, engage and grow together over the summer.

## How should my child dress?

Comfortably! We do not recommend any new clothing items and we require closed toe shoes- No Flip Flops!! Children in flip Flops will not be allowed to enter camp. This is for their safety.

## I may need to contact my child during the day, can they bring their cell phone?

While we understand the need to be able to each your child, we do ask that all electronic devices (phones, games, head phones, etc.) be left at home. Your child will not have time for those items and we are NOT responsible for anything that is lost, stolen or damaged. If it is truly necessary for your child to bring their phone it will be locked up and will be the responsibility of the parent or child to request it at the end of the day when the child is picked up or dismissed to go home.

## Will there be any field trips?

Yes, once a week we will escort the campers down to a local park just one block away from our campus. Other than this, we will be staying at our facilities.
