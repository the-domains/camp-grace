[Schedule][0]

Serving Southwest Fort Worth and beyond, Camp F.U.S.E is a summer day camp that operates for 9 weeks and is conveniently located just off I-20 at 6301 Granbury Road, Fort Worth, TX 76133\.

Our campers explore new ways to have fun with indoor or outdoor activities all while building their character through biblical truths- one may call it an extended version of Vacation Bible School, but it much more than that! Each week we have daily themes, such as Craft & Cooking Day, Career Day, Movie Day, Wet and Messy Day.  
Camp F.U.S.E. is NOT a licensed childcare/daycare center; it is a ministry of a new church, _**[Renovation Community][1]**_. Our church doesn't officially launch until October 1, 2017\. But we occupy the same building of a recently closed church...Grace Tabernacle Church of the Nazarene, which started the day camp in 2014\. Although Grace Tabernacle is now closed, Renovation Community (which has many former members of Grace Tabernacle) decided to continue this vital ministry to families in Southwest Fort Worth.

## Dates

* **Session 1 **June 12- June 29 $40
* **Session 2 **July 5 - July 20th $35
