## Late Policy

Doors open for sign-in at 8:00am. In order for your child to receive breakfast, they must arrive no later than 8:30 am. Daily activities start at 8:30 and your child must arrive by 8:30 am. If a child is tardy more than 3 times they will be dismissed from camp and unable to enroll in another session. Your child must be picked up promptly by 3 pm except on Thursday in which the time is 4:30\. We extend grace until 3:10 pm. If you arrive after 3:10 or 4:40 on Thursday, you will be charged a late fee of $1 per minute that must be paid the next morning or your child cannot be signed in. If you know you will be running late, it is your responsibility to call and let the site coordinator know so we can work with you to avoid late fees. More than 3 late pickups will result in your child being dismissed from camp and not eligible to enroll in another session . If you have not called, or we have not been able to contact you after 3:30 or 4:40 on Thursday, your child will be taken to the police department.

## Meals and Food Service Practices

Meals are pre-packaged and are offered to every child. We will encourage your child to try new foods and use the sharing table to place unopened items on. Breakfast will always be a cold meal and is served from 8am to 8:30 am. Your child must arrive before 8:30 to eat breakfast. Lunch is served from 11:30-12 pm and will consist of two cold meals and two hot meals each week. Your child is able to bring their own lunch however; they cannot bring in any soda, chips, snack cakes or candy. We want to maintain a neutral environment and encourage healthy eating habits.

## Discipline and Guidance Practices

No physical discipline will ever be given to a child by any staff or volunteer at Camp F.U.S.E. We will redirect the child in their actions and if they cannot participate with the rest of the group they will be given a time out. In the case that your child is unable to abide by the rules, is being too disruptive or is causing harm to their self, another child or adult the parent or guardian on file will be contacted for immediate pickup of the child. We will not tolerate disrespect to oneself or another person. If the child has to be picked up they will not be able to return to camp on the next day and depending on the severity of the child's actions they may be dismissed from camp and unable to enroll in another session.

## Procedures for Release of Children

Children have to be signed in upon arrival and signed out upon departure by an adult parent or guardian. Because meal are open to the public, children who are not signed in will only be allowed to participate in meals but will have to leave the campus immediately following meal service.

## Activities

Children will participate in outside / inside play and chapel daily. In addition to that, each day has its own theme: craft and cooking day, career day, movie day and wet 'n' messy day. It is important that you talk to your child about participating in the activities as well as asking them about their day. Chapel is required and is the basis of our program.

## Attire

All children must have on closed toe shoes that allow for running and playing. No flip flops.

## Procedures for Dispensing Medication

Medication will not be administered by any staff or volunteer at Camp F.U.S.E. If your child has need for an asthma pump or allergy pen, he/she will need to be able to self-administer in the case of an emergency. We will be able to store an asthma pump or allergy pen if it is properly labeled.

## Medical Emergencies

In the case of an emergency, 911 will be called and you will be notified. Camp F.U.S.E. staff and volunteers will help with minor emergencies such as scrapes, cuts, bruises and head bumps requiring ice pack. An incident report will be written and go home with the child detailing the need for care.

You are responsible for dropping off and picking up your child each day. If you decided that you want your child to walk home you must inform the site coordinator on the morning that you sign your child in or your child will not be able to leave before 3 pm if they are walking home.
