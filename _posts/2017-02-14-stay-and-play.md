# Extended Fun

Need to drop off or pick up your kids earlier or later?

---

Camp FUSE is wants to provide more for the parents of our campers. We understand that everyone's work schedule is different and that you may need to drop-off or pick-up your kids sooner or later than our typical day. This year, we will be offering those extra times. Before-care will be offered starting at 7:30 AM and after-care is available from 3-6 PM.

Extended Fun available from 7:30am - 6 pm for $25 a week except for week 4 in which the cost is $10 (paid online weekly by Monday morning).
